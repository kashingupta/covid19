<ul>
<li>Machine learning has numerous tools that can be used for visualization and prediction, and nowadays it is used worldwide for study of the pattern of COVID-19 spread.</li> 
<li>One of the main focus of the study in this project is to use machine learning techniques to analyze and visualize the spreading of the virus country-wise as well as globally during a specific period of time by considering confirmed cases, recovered cases and fatalities. This Notebook Covers the Visualization of Covid19 Data. There will gonna an other Notebook as well for Prediction Part of this Project.</li> 
<li>In this project, we are going to perform Linear regression, Support vector machine, Ensemble methods, time series algorithms etc., on the Johns Hopkins University's COVID-19 data to anticipate the future effects of COVID-19 pandemic in the world, India and some other countries. Moreover, we are going to study the impact of some other parameters such as environmental factors, life expectancy, population statistics, etc., in prediction of COVID-19 spread</li> <br/>
  
**Steps:**
<ul>
  <li>Data Wrangling</li>
  <li>Feature Engineering</li>
  <li>Data Visualization</li>
  <li>Auto ARIMA Model</li>
  <li>Linear Regression</li>
  <li>Support Vector Machines</li> </ul>
